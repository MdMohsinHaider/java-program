/**
 *  <li>Which feature in java makes Java Platform independent?
 *  <p> Solution : <code>The code that we write is called source code. Once we write
 *  the code, what do we do then? We compile the code with the
 *  help of Java compiler. Java compiler means Java C. Once the
 *  code is compiled, what does the Java compiler do? It generates
 *  the byte code. Now this byte code is an important thing.
 *  It is such a code that makes Java platform independent.
 *  Once the byte code is generated, what do we do then? It
 *  can be used on any hardware, be it Mac or Windows.
