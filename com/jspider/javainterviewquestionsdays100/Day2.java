 *  <h1>if Only JVM Installed in machine, Then Run the program or not?
 *  <p> Solution : <code> Virtual machine is a specification, it is just a formatted document in
 *  which many things are written, how the program is to be run, how the byte code is to be loaded,
 *  how the byte code is to be executed, how the byte code is to be verified, now comes JRE, our
 *  JRE is an implementation, that means whatever has been written in JVM, this software is made
 *  by implementing it, so this is the implementation of JVM, along with this there is also
 *  this library, that means all those libraries are also in it which will make the program
 *  exit, next we have JDK, so JDK means this is a complete software in which we have the
 *  implementation of JVM as well as libraries and a new thing has come here, development
 *  tools, that means the tools that we need to develop Java C Java program are also
 *  in it, so you have to install GDK, you will get the implementation of JRE along with it.
 *  You will also get JVM with the help of which you will be able to run the program.
