/**
 * <h1>Java Four feature which make java unique from another language.
 * <p> Solution : <code>
 *     1. The first feature is memory management. Java has a component called
 * garbage collector. If you are using an object, then the root selector does not work there.
 * But as soon as your object or reference variable points to null, it removes that object.
 * <p> 2. The second feature is pointers. Implicit pointers are automatically handled in Java.
 * We do not have to handle explicit pointers separately. That means the programmer has nothing
 * to do. He has to sit comfortably.
 * <p>3. The third feature is platform independent. Yes, once you
 * write the Java code, compile it. After compilation, the white code that will be created can be
 * run on any platform. It will not matter. Write once, run anyway.
 * <p>4. The fourth feature is object-oriented. Yes, 99.9% of things are object-oriented.
 * Create class objects and take advantage of their features like inheritance, etc.
