/**
 * <h1>Most important thing in java, if not there, the Program will be not Run.
 * <p> Solution :
 * <li>If you want to write a program in Java,
 * then you have to simply create a class like we have created here.
 * To create a class, you have to write public, write class and then
 * write the name of your class. This should be a proper identifier.
 * Now, inside this class, you have written a lot of code. Let's assume
 * you have created two methods. We can create many methods inside our
 * Java class to perform our task. No matter how many methods you create,
 * if you do not create a main method, then your program will not run because
 * the JVM actually searches for this main method. When you run your program,
 * the main method is our entry point. Public means that the accessibility of
 * this method is public. It can be accessed outside the folder as well.
 * JVM can easily call it. Static means we do not need to create any object.
 * This method is associated with the class, so it will be called directly.
 * Void means method is something. We use void here to represent what we are
 * doing. Main is the name of the main method. You cannot change it. If you
 * change it, the main method will no longer be the main method. Then JVM will
 * not be able to recognize the main method. The string @param args is actually an argument.
 * You can pass many values here to take a command line argument
 * while running your program.
