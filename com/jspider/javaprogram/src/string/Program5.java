     * @Problem Statement:
     *
     * 1. Take two strings as user input.
     * 2. Compare the characters of both strings.
     * 3. Identify and print:
     *    a. Duplicate characters (characters that appear in both strings).
     *    B. Unique characters (characters that appear only in one of the strings).
     *
     * @Approach:
     *
     * - Read two strings from the user.
     * - Convert strings to character arrays or use sets for easier comparison.
     * - Use data structures like HashSet to keep track of:
     *     - Common characters (duplicates).
     *     - Unique characters from both strings.
     * - Iterate through the characters of both strings:
     *     - Check which characters appear in both strings (duplicates).
     *     - Check which characters appear only in one of the strings (unique).
     * - Print the results.
     * - Take two String user input and Compare to Strings Character
     *   - and find and print both duplicate or unique characters.
